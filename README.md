 # README GENERATOR  
  
  ## Description
  The motivation for this project was to create a solution to the repetitive task of making a readme for every project. This was achieved through the implementation of node.js and various other methods that together provide the functionality of creating an entire file within visual studio. Upon further inspection one can see that this project is still incomplete in various ways, but I have faith in my abilities to catch up with course material and apply it back to the missing comppnents in this project.

  ## Installation
  The following  will need to be run in order to have the necessary packages to make the code work and this project works best with node v.16
  ```csharp-interactive
npm i inquirer@8.2.4
```
Then of course you will need to open the integrated terminal of index.js and type the following in the terminal
 ```csharp-interactive
node index.js
```
  ## Usage
You will be prompted to answer up to 7 questions and then you will be asked to select from among various license types to include in your readme. Once you have answered each question, your readme will generate within your project files on visual studio!
